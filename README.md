An OpenGL based renderer. Mostly following the LearnOpenGL tutorials. This project is mostly a learning resource and as such does not follow any strict styles/format/rules and code might not be the tidiest.
I have (sort of) structured the project in such a way that it is modular and easily extended, similar-ish in strucutre for something that might be used in say, a game engine.

## How to use

- `L` - toggle the wireframe rendering mode
- `C` - toggle cursor lock
- `Esc` - quit the application
